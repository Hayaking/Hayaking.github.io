## 一、什么是动态代理
利用反射机制生成一个实现代理接口的匿名类，在调用具体方法前调用InvokeHandler来处理。即动态的生成静态代理
## 二、Java提供的动态代理
InvocationHandler:

	java.lang.reflect
	Interface InvocationHandler
	
	 
	public interface InvocationHandler
	InvocationHandler is the interface implemented by the invocation handler of a proxy instance.
	Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler. When a method is invoked on a proxy instance, the method invocation is encoded and dispatched to the invoke method of its invocation handler.
	Since:
	1.3
	See Also:
	Proxy

Proxy：
```
java.lang.reflect
Class Proxy
java.lang.Object
java.lang.reflect.Proxy

 
public class Proxy
extends Object
implements Serializable
Proxy provides static methods for creating dynamic proxy classes and instances, and it is also the superclass of all dynamic proxy classes created by those methods.
To create a proxy for some interface Foo:
     InvocationHandler handler = new MyInvocationHandler(...);
     Class<?> proxyClass = Proxy.getProxyClass(Foo.class.getClassLoader(), Foo.class);
     Foo f = (Foo) proxyClass.getConstructor(InvocationHandler.class).
                     newInstance(handler);
 
or more simply:
     Foo f = (Foo) Proxy.newProxyInstance(Foo.class.getClassLoader(),
                                          new Class<?>[] { Foo.class },
                                          handler);
 
A dynamic proxy class (simply referred to as a proxy class below) is a class that implements a list of interfaces specified at runtime when the class is created, with behavior as described below. A proxy interface is such an interface that is implemented by a proxy class. A proxy instance is an instance of a proxy class. Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler object, which implements the interface InvocationHandler. A method invocation on a proxy instance through one of its proxy interfaces will be dispatched to the invoke method of the instance's invocation handler, passing the proxy instance, a java.lang.reflect.Method object identifying the method that was invoked, and an array of type Object containing the arguments. The invocation handler processes the encoded method invocation as appropriate and the result that it returns will be returned as the result of the method invocation on the proxy instance.
A proxy class has the following properties:
Proxy classes are public, final, and not abstract if all proxy interfaces are public.
Proxy classes are non-public, final, and not abstract if any of the proxy interfaces is non-public.
The unqualified name of a proxy class is unspecified. The space of class names that begin with the string "$Proxy" should be, however, reserved for proxy classes.
A proxy class extends java.lang.reflect.Proxy.
A proxy class implements exactly the interfaces specified at its creation, in the same order.
If a proxy class implements a non-public interface, then it will be defined in the same package as that interface. Otherwise, the package of a proxy class is also unspecified. Note that package sealing will not prevent a proxy class from being successfully defined in a particular package at runtime, and neither will classes already defined by the same class loader and the same package with particular signers.
Since a proxy class implements all of the interfaces specified at its creation, invoking getInterfaces on its Class object will return an array containing the same list of interfaces (in the order specified at its creation), invoking getMethods on its Class object will return an array of Method objects that include all of the methods in those interfaces, and invoking getMethod will find methods in the proxy interfaces as would be expected.
The Proxy.isProxyClass method will return true if it is passed a proxy class-- a class returned by Proxy.getProxyClass or the class of an object returned by Proxy.newProxyInstance-- and false otherwise.
The java.security.ProtectionDomain of a proxy class is the same as that of system classes loaded by the bootstrap class loader, such as java.lang.Object, because the code for a proxy class is generated by trusted system code. This protection domain will typically be granted java.security.AllPermission.
Each proxy class has one public constructor that takes one argument, an implementation of the interface InvocationHandler, to set the invocation handler for a proxy instance. Rather than having to use the reflection API to access the public constructor, a proxy instance can be also be created by calling the Proxy.newProxyInstance method, which combines the actions of calling Proxy.getProxyClass with invoking the constructor with an invocation handler.
A proxy instance has the following properties:
Given a proxy instance proxy and one of the interfaces implemented by its proxy class Foo, the following expression will return true:
      proxy instanceof Foo
 
and the following cast operation will succeed (rather than throwing a ClassCastException):
      (Foo) proxy
 
Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler, the one that was passed to its constructor. The static Proxy.getInvocationHandler method will return the invocation handler associated with the proxy instance passed as its argument.
An interface method invocation on a proxy instance will be encoded and dispatched to the invocation handler's invoke method as described in the documentation for that method.
An invocation of the hashCode, equals, or toString methods declared in java.lang.Object on a proxy instance will be encoded and dispatched to the invocation handler's invoke method in the same manner as interface method invocations are encoded and dispatched, as described above. The declaring class of the Method object passed to invoke will be java.lang.Object. Other public methods of a proxy instance inherited from java.lang.Object are not overridden by a proxy class, so invocations of those methods behave like they do for instances of java.lang.Object.
Methods Duplicated in Multiple Proxy Interfaces
When two or more interfaces of a proxy class contain a method with the same name and parameter signature, the order of the proxy class's interfaces becomes significant. When such a duplicate method is invoked on a proxy instance, the Method object passed to the invocation handler will not necessarily be the one whose declaring class is assignable from the reference type of the interface that the proxy's method was invoked through. This limitation exists because the corresponding method implementation in the generated proxy class cannot determine which interface it was invoked through. Therefore, when a duplicate method is invoked on a proxy instance, the Method object for the method in the foremost interface that contains the method (either directly or inherited through a superinterface) in the proxy class's list of interfaces is passed to the invocation handler's invoke method, regardless of the reference type through which the method invocation occurred.
If a proxy interface contains a method with the same name and parameter signature as the hashCode, equals, or toString methods of java.lang.Object, when such a method is invoked on a proxy instance, the Method object passed to the invocation handler will have java.lang.Object as its declaring class. In other words, the public, non-final methods of java.lang.Object logically precede all of the proxy interfaces for the determination of which Method object to pass to the invocation handler.
Note also that when a duplicate method is dispatched to an invocation handler, the invoke method may only throw checked exception types that are assignable to one of the exception types in the throws clause of the method in all of the proxy interfaces that it can be invoked through. If the invoke method throws a checked exception that is not assignable to any of the exception types declared by the method in one of the proxy interfaces that it can be invoked through, then an unchecked UndeclaredThrowableException will be thrown by the invocation on the proxy instance. This restriction means that not all of the exception types returned by invoking getExceptionTypes on the Method object passed to the invoke method can necessarily be thrown successfully by the invoke method.

1.3

## 三、先讲讲静态代理
假设现在我们有一个Animal接口和其一个实现类Cat，代码如下
Animal:
```java
public interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void run();
}
```
Cat:
```java
public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println( "吃鱼" );
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println( "猫步" );
    }
}
```
现在有一个要求，规定在不修改Animal和Cat的代码的情况下，仅将Cat的eat函数的输出改为“吃屎”。
这里你可以使用**静态代理**模式，实现起来也比较简单，代码如下：
```java
public class CatProxy implements Animal {
	Cat obj=null;
	CatProxy(Cat obj){
		this.obj = obj;
	}
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println( "吃屎" );
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        obj.run();
    }
}
```
但是静态代理有一个缺点，就是当Cat类中的函数很多时，假设有100个，我只想修改其中1个，就仍需要在CatProxy中调用其他99个不会被修改的函数。而且当修改Animal接口时，不仅要修改Cat类，还需要修改CatProxy类。如此看来，静态代理虽然简单，但一旦遇到稍微复杂的地方，就变得十分冗余繁琐，不易维护。

## 四、如何使用Java提供的动态代理模式
还是Animal接口和Cat类：

Animal:
```java
public interface Animal {
    void eat();
    void run();
}
```
Cat:
```java
public class Cat implements Animal {
    @Override
    public void eat() {
        System.out.println( "吃鱼" );
    }

    @Override
    public void run() {
        System.out.println( "猫步" );
    }
}
```
接下来使用Java提供的动态代理，新建一个CatInvoc类，并实现InvocationHandler接口，代码如下：
```java
public class CatInvoc implements InvocationHandler {
    private Animal obj;

    public CatInvoc(Animal obj) {
        this.obj = obj;
    }
    /**
     * @param proxy 不怎么用
     * @param method 函数对象
     * @param args 参数
     * @return 
     * @throws Throwable
     */
    @Override
    public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
        Object invoke = null;
      
        return invoke;
    }
}
```
还是刚刚那个需求，仅将Cat的eat函数的输出改为“吃屎”，代码如下：
```java
@Override
public Object invoke(Object proxy, Method method, Object[] args) throws Throwable {
    Object invoke = null;
    if ("eat".equals( method.getName() )) {
        System.out.println( "吃屎" );
    } else {
        invoke = method.invoke( obj, args );
    }
    return invoke;
}
```
这里通过method.getName()获取函数名，当函数名为eat时，执行System.out.println( "吃屎" )。其他情况时则执行invoke = method.invoke( obj, args )，正常执行被代理对象的函数。
接下来新建一个CatProxy类，代码如下：
```java
import java.lang.reflect.Proxy;

public class CatProxy {
    Animal getAnimal(Animal animal) {
        return (Animal) Proxy.newProxyInstance( 
        		animal.getClass().getClassLoader(),
                animal.getClass().getInterfaces(),
                new CatInvoc( animal ) );
    }
}
```
getAnimal()用于返回一个代理对象。Proxy.newProxyInstance(类加载器，接口，invoc对象)通过反射创建出一个代理对象，不难看出动态代理的本质就是动态的生成静态代理。
